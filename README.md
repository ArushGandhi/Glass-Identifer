# Glass Type Classification and Housing Prices Rgression
- Predicted the type of glass and price of a house based using a custom k-Nearest Neighbors function built from scratch in R.
- Built various functions for normalizing data, calculating Euclidean distance between neighboring points and then finding the k smallest distances and eventually implementing the kNN function on the training and testing datasets produced through stratified sampling.
- Used k-NN function from Class package to compare results.
